Tooling and raw content for my [Pelican-powered](https://getpelican.com/) GitHub Pages website [mattleaverton.com](https://www.mattleaverton.com)

FYI: prepare site content to publish with:

    pelican content -s publishconf.py

## TODO
- main page to article page shifts alignment of image
- automatically append `{: target=_blank}` to every link
- the gray bar at the top of the page is thin and can be scrolled above on many platforms
- need cover images for more articles or something - painfully blank
- reading pages need more contrast between sections - everything blends
- update workstation setup and add a picture
- order the books read by updated date
