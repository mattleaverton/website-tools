Status: published

This is the year I began reading again in earnest after a college-induced break. The birth of my first son motivated me 
to find something better to do in the small fractured spaces between activities than flip out my phone again. 

**Highlights of the year:**

* Second time through the Harry Potter books - first time was in 2010
* First time through Brandon Sanderson's Stormlight Archive to celebrate the new (to me) release of Oathbringer. 
This series is thoroughly enjoyable, but a serious commitment. I pushed through too hard and burned out on books until December.
