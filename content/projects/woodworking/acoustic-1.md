Status: published
Phase: Complete

Created for the 2005 [Science Olympiad](https://scilympiad.com/tx){: target=_blank} newly created **Sound of Music** 
category. The rules of the pair event were to create two musical instruments from scratch using minimal pre-fabricated
parts, then play a duet.

Modeled the guitar after my [Martin 000CXE](https://reverb.com/p/martin-000cxe-black-2002-2013){: target=_blank}. Dremeled
out the pieces to create the top, back, and sides. Eye bolts for tuners, nails for frets, golf tees to hold the strings.
Real guitar strings were the only manufactured allowance. My partner built a violin with similar constraints.

Our competition piece was *Simple Gifts* with which we won 1st place at the state competition.

Thanks to my science and physics teacher [Mr. Peikert](https://www.facebook.com/PeikertFarms){: target=_blank} for 
running the Science Olympiad team and always encouraging me to build and try wild things.
