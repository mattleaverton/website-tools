As with all worthwhile projects, this one begins with a request for permission from the HOA

Planning with HOA - email on Jan 5, 2021

Plan for "Obstacle Course" from [DIYTyler](https://www.diytyler.com/shop/obstacle-course/){: target=_blank} - made modifications to suit our needs

Online order of all lumber pre-COVID prices - crushed my worktable wheels under the weight

Took a break when the state froze for a few days and took the power with it

The best part of the whole project - space to hang a hammock. This is MKII of hammock hanging
solution - initially tried hanging with wire rope to a painful conclusion. Successfully used
hooks for a [porch swing](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07SSKPKWN){: target=_blank}, which are 
perfectly spaced for my [hammock](https://eaglesnestoutfittersinc.com/products/doublenest-hammock?variant=41567315984533){: target=_blank}
to clip directly into (as I did, in fact, ensure the dimensions of the playset would be ideal for hammock hanging).
