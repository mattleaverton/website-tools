Summary: Second guitar build, scrapped into science competition
Status: published
Phase: Complete

[Encouraged by my success]({filename}acoustic-1.md) at creating a reasonable musical instrument, I set out to try again.
In tandem with friends [Mr. Peikert](https://www.facebook.com/PeikertFarms){: target=_blank} and [Vikram](https://www.planthropologypod.com/){: target=_blank},
we ordered real wood and attempted to build guitars from scratch.

My effort was decent, and I almost made it through bending the sides (hairdryer and spray bottle) without breaking all 
the wood. Ultimately, it was an unsuccessful journey - not enough planning or patience at this point most likely. The 
scrap was able to become my repeat showing at the [Science Olympiad](https://scilympiad.com/tx){: target=_blank}
**Sound of Music** competition. 

Less successful this time - the judges were unimpressed that I made a guitar two years in a row with no demonstrable 
innovation in the process (even though this one looked and felt much more real). Ultimately that was the least important
part, because I already had the bug.

Thanks again to my science and physics teacher [Mr. Peikert](https://www.facebook.com/PeikertFarms){: target=_blank} for 
running the Science Olympiad team and always encouraging me to build and try wild things (and in this case, building wild
things with me).
