Side contract prototype project for a friend of a friend in medical school to create a monitor to
alert you when you have been sitting for too long. The prototype used an [MSP430](https://www.ti.com/product/MSP430G2553/part-details/MSP430G2553IN20){: target=_blank} for brains with a 
[pressure sensor mat](https://www.surveillance-video.com/security-925.html){: target=_blank} that could be sewn into a seat cushion to detect whether the user was
sitting or standing. After a user had been seated for <configurable length of time>, a buzzer would
remind the user to stand up and take a break.
