My first blog was a WordPress site borne from a long forgotten University assignment. Undoubtedly it was meandering, 
inane, and self-important - I am grateful that even the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/web){: target=_blank} 
has misplaced the details. 

Thanks to Aaron Francis in his article [Publishing your work increases your luck](https://github.com/readme/guides/publishing-your-work){: target=_blank},
I have reconsidered my hang-up about not writing because I have nothing to say, and instead am inspired that I may have 
things to share that could be of interest to someone. I am discovering joy in the process of sharing itself and I 
hope others may find some joy in my work as well.

Let's play a quick game of thought association: One theme of the article is the "Luck Surface Area", which is reminiscent to me 
of the Attack Surface concept in cybersecurity (as taught to me by my colleague [Chris](https://us.artechhouse.com/Medical-Device-Cybersecurity-for-Engineers-and-Manufacturers-P2128.aspx){: target=_blank}).
Thinking of Chris reminded me of a quote from one of his training sessions:

> "Hacking is not a naturally occurring event - there is a malicious, intelligent force at work" - Chris Gates

Similarly, writing is not a natural event, but one undertaken with deliberation and care. With intent to be malicious 
rarely and intelligent occasionally, here I am to do as the handily-tweetable featured quote of the main
article recommends:
