My first blog was a Wordpress site borne from a long forgotten University assignment. Undoubtedly it was meandering, inane,
and self-important - I am grateful that even the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/web){: target=_blank} has misplaced the details. 
For years I have resisted writing because I have nothing I wish to say - no platform to (), no product to shill 

Thanks to Aaron Francis in his article [Publishing your work increases your luck](https://github.com/readme/guides/publishing-your-work){: target=_blank},
I am inspired that I may instead have things to share


He writes of your "Luck Surface Area" increasing as word spreads - reminiscent of my colleague [Chris](https://us.artechhouse.com/Medical-Device-Cybersecurity-for-Engineers-and-Manufacturers-P2128.aspx){: target=_blank}

With age I am discovering joy in the process of sharing itself and I hope others may find some joy in my work as well.

With intent to be rarely malicious occasionally intelligent, here I am to do as the handily-tweetable featured quote of the
article recommends: 

> "Whatever youâ€™re excited about, be excited about it publicly."
