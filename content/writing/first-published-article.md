Med-Tech Innovation News published an article I wrote on the "Build vs Buy" debate from the perspective 
of risk and design simplicity - first writing of mine out in public! 

[Build vs Buy in automated test stations](https://www.med-technews.com/medtech-insights/medtech-materials-and-assembly-insights/build-vs-buy-in-automated-test-stations/){: target=_blank} [[Archive]](https://web.archive.org/web/20220919021108/https://www.med-technews.com/medtech-insi[%E2%80%A6]nd-assembly-insights/build-vs-buy-in-automated-test-stations/){: target=_blank}

This article was inspired by my desire
to listen to my inner [code-monkey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEBld6I_AKs){: target=_blank} engineer when designing a project solution. 
Inevitably I will need a reminder of this, so I hope future Matt will stop long enough to remember:

> The most efficient, effective, and efficacious design element is "nothing"

and

> ...simplify, simplify, simplify
