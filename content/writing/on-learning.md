In grade school I did a report on C.S. Lewis after reading his [sci-fi trilogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_of_the_Silent_Planet){: target=_blank}.
I recall from whichever online, non-Wikipedia source was allowed for school projects that his primary interest/study 
was *Philology*. The dictionary told me this was someone who loves learning or study, which is really nothing more useful than a direct translation
of the constituent Latin roots ([high-school-Latin-flex](https://www.aclclassics.org/DesktopModules/Revindex.Dnn.RevindexStorefront/Portals/0/Gallery/6871c630-33cb-4a6f-b9ec-8cab1ac0c833.jpg){: target=_blank}
- where my fellow [Caecilius](https://www.na4.cambridgescp.com/stage/na4/1){: target=_blank} fans at?) Either with age or a better dictionary, I see this is moreso
the study of learning itself, but the idea that someone's focus can be learning still resonates with me.

For an extended period of my life, I memorized license plates. I can still recall the plate from my mom's 
minivan in mid-90s, 2 plates from my neighbors who moved away in 2003, and multiple plates from high school. 

Precious mind space
Spend it carefully on things that matter - not license plates
Minimize mind-traffic
Like the idea of JIT learning



Like the idea from Holmes; not feeling as pompous or sociopathism
I take comfort in Sherlock Holmes justification (although I )

Just in time learning - from [this newsletter](https://us15.campaign-archive.com/?e=07c8fead8e&u=3f4551eb6b068b6cc1ef205c1&id=8114152795){: target=_blank}

Probably scratch

A brief listing of apparently common knowledge that I cannot crack:

* What my favorite music is (I keep a spreadsheet now to aid in answering)
* Names of people I do not interact with regularly
* What allergens are in the air right now
* How to efficiently navigate a grocery store
* How to find scores or game times for any sports
* Names, locations, and reputation of schools in my area
* Details on a topic I find uninteresting
*
